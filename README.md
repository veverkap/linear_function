## Algorithm Assignment ##
*Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the 4 highest in O(n) time. We'd like to see how you think about algorithms and data structures, so as appropriate, use your own logic instead of calling out to libraries.*

I couldn't help myself - I did the assignment in two languages [Elixir](elixir/) and [Ruby](ruby/)
